Dependency Injection in .NET [Full-Day Workshop]
============================
Loosely coupled code is easier to maintain, extend, and test. Dependency Injection (DI) help us get there. In this workshop, we'll see how interfaces can add "seams" to our code that makes it more flexible and maintainable. From there, we'll dig into loose coupling with Dependency Injection. DI doesn't have to be complicated. With just a few simple changes to our constructors or properties, we can have code that is easy to extend and test.  

After laying a good foundation, we'll take a closer look by diving into various DI patterns (such as constructor injection and property injection) as well as other patterns that help us handle interception and optional dependencies. Along the way, we'll see how DI helps us adhere to the SOLID principles in our code. We'll also we'll look at common stumbling blocks like dealing with constructor over-injection, managing static dependencies, and handling disposable dependencies.  

Throughout the day, we'll go hands-on with labs to give you a chance to put the concepts into action.  

If you're a C# developer who wants to get better with concepts like abstraction, loose coupling, extensibility, and unit testing, then this is the workshop for you.
